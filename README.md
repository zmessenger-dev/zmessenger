ZMessenger
==========

ZMessenger is an unofficial 3rd party desktop client for f-list.net's f-chat.

The aim of this project is to provide a cross-platform client, with a particular
interest in Linux support.

To use the client, you'll need to build it from source. For that, you'll need
*Qt 5.0+*. You may also need to check that the websockets, json, and multimedia
portions of Qt have been included. No other dependencies required.

You can then build ZMessenger using `make`.

## Features:

* Global ad filter, which can filter on parameters such as line count, character
  count, and tag count.

* PM's automatically logged (logs/&lt;your name&gt;_&lt;their name&gt;)

* Users can be marked 'not interested', hiding their RP ads.

* A top section holds the name and status information of the last person you
  checked.
